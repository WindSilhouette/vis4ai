# Visualizing Reinforcement Learning
Collaborated with Benat Froemming
This repository is part of the final project in CSCI 8615 VIS4AI. We present a website structured as a mini-course that visualizes two RL algorithms, Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning, across two distinct types of environments:
CliffWalk, representing discrete state spaces, and CartPole, representing continuous state spaces.
